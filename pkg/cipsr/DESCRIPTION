Description: CIPS-R was developed by Nathaniel Osborne, Doug Maguire and David
    Hann at the Center for Intensive Planted-forest Silviculture (CIPS). CIPS
    is a research institute at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.
    This package provides an interface to the Organon and Cipsanon forest
    growth, yield and wood quality models.  These models allow users to
    empirically simulate the development of forests, of many species given
    various silvicultural regimes.  Both models simulate forest development at
    the resolution of spatially implicit, individual trees. Currently, CIPS-R
    cannot be distributed publicly. The use of CIPS-R is limited to members of
    the CIPS cooperative.
