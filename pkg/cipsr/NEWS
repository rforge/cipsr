THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "cipsr" PACKAGE

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2

* Vignette was updated with solutions for big data problems

* More effective R code was written to handle output from Organon and Cipsanon

* General debugging of a few user-reported issues

* Vignette renamed to "introduction": this change may cause some issues for a few users relying 
on older instructions.  Best to use help(package="cipsr") moving forward.
